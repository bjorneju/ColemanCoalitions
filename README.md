# Coleman Coalitions

This package was made in relation to work done for an article by G. Hernes and B.E. Juel (to be published). In the article we used the concepts introduced by Coleman in his 1973 book *The Mathematics of Collective Action* to analyze the formation of coalitions within the collective. To do this, we impplemented the Coleman's mathematical framework in python, and extended it to include new concepts regarding the value of coalitions. 

Please feel free to use this package when quantifying power relations within the collective you are analyzing. If you use the package for academic work or business related purposes, please reference the package (using DOI as well as *reference*) as well as the related articles (*here* and *here').

Documentation for the package can be found *here*, and some suggestions for applications can be found in our article (*reference*). Background information about the relevant concepts can be found in earlier publications by Coleman (for example *here* and *here*).

Please refer to the published code (we tried to keep it well commented) as well as the tutorial paper (*here*) to get started. But feel free to get in touch with us (email: bjorneju@gmail.com) for specific questions.

Good luck!
